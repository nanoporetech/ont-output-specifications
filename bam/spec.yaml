        Mandatory.
        e.g. "12ddefc_2021-05-17_dna_r9.4.1_minion_96_29d8704b_barcode02".

            run_id is mandatory, if it is missing a read group will not be created.
            model_version_id if missing shall be replaced with the text "unknown"
            e.g. "12ddefc_unknown_barcode02"
            barcode_data::arrangement if missing the suffix will not be appended.
            e.g. "12ddefc_2021-05-17_dna_r9.4.1_minion_96_29d8704b"

        This will be the same barcode descriptor guppy uses for generating the output folder names,
        which is the sample sheet alias if available otherwise defaulting to the arrangement name.
