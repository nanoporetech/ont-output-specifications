        ``<program_id>{_<unique_id>}``

        The SAM specification requires this field to be unique within a file, and may be modified on merging to ensure
        uniqueness. Where the program_id would not be unique within the file, e.g. when the input is a bam/sam file
        with the program_id already present, then the @PG record will have the lowest zero based suffix that can be
        appended to the ID to ensure its uniqueness, e.g. "_0".
        Where an application has used the minimap aligner on reads contained in the file, as well as outputting a @PG
        record for itself it will also output an additional @PG record for minimap
        dorado aligner records will have the ID "dorado_aligner" to disambiguate from minimap aligner records.
        Programs will identify themselves as follows
        ont_basecall_client "basecaller"
        dorado basecaller "basecaller"
        dorado barcoder "barcoder"
        dorado aligner "dorado_aligner"
        minimap2 (if used in the application) "aligner"
