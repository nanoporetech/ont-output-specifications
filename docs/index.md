Introduction
============

This document describes the output specification for the Oxford Nanopore Technologies suite of products in a readable format.

Currently, this project primarily contains MinKNOW outputs. Further specifications, including additional outputs from EPI2ME and [standalone Dorado](https://github.com/nanoporetech/dorado), are planned for a future release. Until then, details of these projects can be found in the [EPI2ME Docs](https://epi2me.nanoporetech.com/epi2me-docs/quickstart/) and [Dorado Docs](https://dorado-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

Parsable formats are available [in the repository]({{specification.git_url}}).
