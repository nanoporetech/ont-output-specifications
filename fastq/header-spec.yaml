    - name: runid
      description: |
        A random-generated unique identifier for the data acquisition (eg:
        17ade39e46480582ef4b7285f3511ac2551e5d22) This consists only of lower-case ASCII letters
        (a-z) and digits (0-9). Note that this is different to the protocol run ID used in the
        protocol output directory name.
    - name: read
      description: |
        A per-channel read counter. This number will increase for each read on a given channel, but
        the numbers of written-out reads will not usually be consecutive.
        It will always be at least 1.
    - name: ch
      description: |
        The number of the channel the read was acquired on. The first channel is 1.
    - name: start_time
      description: |
        The time the read started in RFC3339 format.
    - name: flow_cell_id
      description: |
        The human-readable identifier for the flow cell (eg: FAK54854).
    - name: protocol_group_id
      description: |
        Set by the user in the GUI as "Experiment ID".
    - name: sample_id
      description: |
        Set by the user in the GUI as "Sample ID".
    - name: barcode
      description: |
        The barcode assigned to this read by guppy (eg: "barcode01"). Omitted completely (both key
        and value) if barcoding is not running.
    - name: barcode_alias
      description: |
        The user-supplied alias for the barcode. Omitted completely (both key and value) if
        barcoding is not running. The same as barcode if the user did not supply an alias.
    - name: parent_read_id
      descroption: |
        The read_id of the read which was the source of this fastq entry. This may be the same as the
        fastq entry id if no read splitting was performed for this read, or will be a new globally
        unique UUID value if this read was split out of another read by guppy.
    - name: basecall_model_version_id
      description: |
        The unique identifier for the basecall model used to generate
        this fastq file, as supplied by the guppy basecaller
        (e.g. 2021-05-17_dna_r9.4.1_minion_384_d37a2ab9).
